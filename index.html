                    <p>Hello!!. Welcome to my profile ,my name is Piyathida Puttharaksa
                        I was born on 23 October 1997.So this profile I want to inform about
                        myself and some of my work exprirences where I used to work,
                        and the jobs which I had done, so the first Job that I started,
                        I work at Thai restuarant that have been opened over 10 years. I worked there
                        from 2016-2017 then I left. Next I worked for part-time Job and being a volunteer.
                        I had beem starting to travel to chiangmai mayny times, so then I decided
                        to move to chiangmai to stay with my cousin and worked with tour company
                        “Trinity Travel chiangmai” I worked there from 2018-2019. I decided
                        to move to Bangkok on 24 December and I worked with tour company
                        “Dobson Traveller Club” because I want to study in bangkok and want to work
                        for support myself and later on Corona vius spreading, so tourist couldn’t come to thailand
                        and then I decided to find a new Job so I told them that I want to find a new job.
                        I went to apply for barista, I don’t have exprirence about coffee shop.
                        After I interviewed, they said that they accepted me to be their imployee. So, the
                        company wich I am working on is “Palette Artspace” for part-time job.</p>
